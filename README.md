# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Naiyer!

Iâ€™m a software engineer from India. My professional experience exists at the intersection of the backend, frontend, databases, and lately, cloud. With a lot of application design, requirements analysis and documentation sprinkled on top.

Currently, I work on an Aerospace product. Before this, I was a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/).
