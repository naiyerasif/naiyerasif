### Hello, I'm Naiyer!

I work on an Aerospace product where I build microservices and enterprise API. Before this, I worked as a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/) and as an <abbr title="Extract Transform Load">ETL</abbr> consultant for [Suncorp](https://www.suncorp.com.au/).

I've mostly worked on [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), relational databases (mostly [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and recently [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/). I've also worked reasonably often on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/).

I write a blog on software engineering and other stuff at [naiyerasif.com](https://www.naiyerasif.com). Feel free to look around and contact me with any questions at [@naiyer@mastodon.design](https://mastodon.design/@naiyer).
