# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Naiyer.

I work as a software engineer on an Aerospace product, focused on backend and cloud, with occasional forays into frontend. Before this, I was a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/). I relish tackling design and engineering problems, preferably in short bursts, with a healthy dose of pragmatism. When Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™m reading.
