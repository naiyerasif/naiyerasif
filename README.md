# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Naiyer!

I'm a software engineer from India. I've worked on the frontend, backend, and more recently, cloud. I enjoy tackling design and engineering problems, and I prefer to do so in short bursts with a healthy amount of pragmatism.

Currently, I work on an Aerospace product. Before this, I was a full-stack engineer at [Wipro Holmes](https://www.wipro.com/holmes/).
