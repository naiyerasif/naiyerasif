### HelloðŸ‘‹, I'm Naiyer!

Currently, I'm wearing the hat of a backend engineer on an Aviation product where I write microservices using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). Now and then, I also contribute to the reference implementation of my organization's design system.

In the past, I've worked on site reliability, frontend, and ETL projects, in Legal &amp; Compliance, Document Processing, and Banking &amp; Financial Services domains.

I'm adept at
- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- Relational databases (mostly [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/))
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

From time to time, I also work on
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) and [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
- CSS, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/)
- [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) (mostly with [Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/))
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

I read a fair amount of science fiction and fantasy books. I frequently draw vector icons and illustrations. More often than not, I also hunt for interesting typography and new tools that improve my learning process, recollection, and productivity.

I write a blog on design and development at <https://mflash.dev>. Feel free to look around and contact me with any questions at [@Microflash](https://www.twitter.com/Microflash).
